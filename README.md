# Code from the article: 'Toward predictable 5'UTRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Development of a yUTR calculator'

In this repository, you can find the code from our article about the yUTR calculator for the development of predictable 5'UTRs in yeast.
To this end, we hope that this will be useful for others to repeat or build further on our results.
